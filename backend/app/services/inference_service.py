"""
InferenceService — abstraction over sign-recognition inference.

STATUS: interface only. Real implementation requires the CV pipeline
(MediaPipe landmark extraction, Phase 6-7) and a trained temporal model
(Phase 9-10), neither of which exist yet.

We deliberately do NOT return a fake/hardcoded prediction here (see
master-prompt rule "НЕ РОБИ FAKE AI"). Calling predict() before a real
model is wired up raises MLNotReadyError with a clear message, so any
caller (WebSocket handler, tests) gets an honest signal instead of a
silently-wrong answer.

Once Phase 9/10 land, a concrete `MediaPipeSignRecognizer` (or
`TransformerSignRecognizer`, `VideoJEPASignRecognizer`, etc.) will
subclass `InferenceService` and be selected via `MODEL_TYPE` in .env /
configs/model.yaml — the rest of the backend (WebSocket handler) will
be unaffected by which concrete model is active.
