"""
TranslationService — abstraction over gloss-sequence -> natural Ukrainian text
(and the reverse direction, text -> gloss sequence for the avatar).

STATUS: both directions are real as of Phase 14. RuleBasedTranslationService
delegates gloss_to_text() to ml/nlp/gloss_to_text.py (Phase 12) and
text_to_gloss() to ml/nlp/text_to_gloss.py (Phase 14) -- genuine (if narrow,
hand-authored lexicon) rule-based engines per master-prompt section 14/17,
sharing one lexicon (ml/nlp/lexicon.py) so the two directions can never
silently disagree about vocabulary.

Later an HF-Transformers-backed implementation can replace either direction
via `NLP_BACKEND=huggingface` in .env without touching callers.
