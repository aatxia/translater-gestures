"""
gloss_to_text — rule-based УЖМ gloss sequence -> natural Ukrainian sentence
(section 14/17). Framework-agnostic (no FastAPI import); wrapped by
backend/app/services/translation_service.py::RuleBasedTranslationService.

This is a genuine (if narrow) grammar engine, not `' '.join(gloss_sequence)`:
it conjugates verbs by subject person, declines nouns into whichever case
the verb governs, handles preverbal negation ("не" before the verb, the
correct position in Ukrainian -- not wherever NOT happened to appear in the
gloss order), and composes standard Ukrainian word order from sign order
(which doesn't have to match it).

Coverage is intentionally small: no public annotated УЖМ dataset exists yet
(Phase 8), so there is no real gloss vocabulary to build a broad lexicon
from -- see ml/nlp/lexicon.py, shared with ml/nlp/text_to_gloss.py (Phase 14)
so the two directions never disagree about vocabulary. An unrecognized
gloss, or a recognized-glosses-but-unrecognized-pattern combination, raises
a clear, typed error rather than guessing a plausible-looking but possibly
ungrammatical sentence -- the same "no fake AI" rule the rest of this
project follows for CV/ML.

Phase 16: a run of consecutive FS_ fingerspelling gloss tokens (see
ml/nlp/fingerspelling.py) composes into the word they spell -- standalone,
or filling the object slot of the SVO pattern. Spelling is caseless/formless
(exactly the letters that were spelled, capitalized), never Ukrainian-
declined into the verb's governed case the way a lexicon NOUN is -- there's
no real declension data for arbitrary fingerspelled words to draw on.

Phase 17: `is_question` swaps the trailing "." for "?" -- sign language
questions are marked non-manually (raised eyebrows for yes/no, furrowed for
wh-, section 19), never by a separate manual gloss, so there's no "?" gloss
token for a caller to include. See ml/features/facial_grammar.py, which
detects this from face landmarks; the caller decides whether it applies.

Subject position accepts a pronoun OR a noun (e.g. ["CAR", "PAST", "RIDE"]
-> "Машина їхала.") -- not only pronoun-subject sentences. An optional
TENSE_PAST_GLOSS marker right before the verb switches it to past tense
(gender/number agreement with the subject, per lexicon.py's module
docstring); zero or more trailing ADVERBS entries (time words) can follow
the verb/object. None of this reorders sign order into a different spoken
order -- these are still exactly the tokens gloss_to_text.py was given,
composed left to right.
