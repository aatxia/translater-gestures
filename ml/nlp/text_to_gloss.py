"""
text_to_gloss — rule-based Ukrainian text -> УЖМ gloss sequence (section 14,
Phase 14). The reverse of ml/nlp/gloss_to_text.py's compose_sentence(),
built from the same shared lexicon (ml/nlp/lexicon.py) so the two directions
never silently disagree about vocabulary -- anything this project can
compose into text, it can also parse back out of text, and vice versa.

Framework-agnostic (no FastAPI import); wrapped by
backend/app/services/translation_service.py::RuleBasedTranslationService.

Word order is NOT reordered into sign-language grammar (topic-comment,
classifier constructions, etc.) -- that's a substantially harder linguistic
problem this rule-based baseline doesn't attempt. Glosses come out in the
same order their Ukrainian surface forms appeared in the input text. That
happens to already match the gloss order gloss_to_text.py composes (SVO
with preverbal negation, since Ukrainian negation is already preverbal) for
every pattern this project currently supports -- a real limitation for any
future pattern where sign order and spoken order would genuinely differ.

A word in the input that isn't in the lexicon is fingerspelled letter-by-
letter (Phase 16, ml/nlp/fingerspelling.py) rather than dropped or guessed
-- a real fallback deaf signers use for names/loanwords, not a workaround.

A past-tense verb form (e.g. "їхала") expands into TWO gloss tokens, the
TENSE_PAST_GLOSS marker followed by the verb's gloss -- not folded into a
single "past-tense" gloss -- since lexicon.py represents tense as a
separate marker gloss (see its module docstring). A noun in subject
position (e.g. "Машина" in "Машина їхала...") isn't special-cased here at
all: it's just another recognized word, resolved via the same reverse
index nouns already populate for object position (their "nominative" form
was always indexed) -- gloss_to_text.py is what decides whether a noun in
that position forms a valid sentence.
Only a word containing a character with no dactyl handshape (Latin script,
digits, ...) raises UnrecognizedWordError.
