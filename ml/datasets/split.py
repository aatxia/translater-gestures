"""
split — signer-independent train/val/test split (section 11).

Hard rule, not a preference: a single `signer_id` must never appear in more
than one split. If the same person's samples land in both train and test,
a model can reach high test accuracy by recognizing *that signer's*
appearance/handshape quirks instead of the sign itself -- the evaluation
would look good and mean nothing. So the unit this splitter assigns is a
whole signer, never an individual sample.
